## The Grain Docs

These docs are divided into two sectionsâ€”the **Standard Library** and **Language Constructs**.

### Standard Library

The Standard Library docs document all of the modules that comprise Grain's standard library, along with detailed information about the values that can be imported from them.

### Language Constructs

The Language Constructs docs provide detailed information about the semantics of all of Grain's language features.
