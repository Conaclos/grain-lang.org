As more editors are supported, they will be added here.

## Visual Studio Code

The premier editor for Grain is Visual Studio Code. We're not quite yet ready to publish the extension, so there is a single manual step to install it.

### Clone the Extension

It's easiest to clone the extension into your VSCode extensions directory.

```bash
cd ~/.vscode/extensions
git clone git@github.com:ospencer/vscode-grain.git
```

And that's it. To update the extension, just `git pull` in the vscode-grain directory.
