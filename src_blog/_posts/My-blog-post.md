New-new-Doctor. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.

There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Don't you think she looks tired? Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. New-new-Doctor. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.

## Subheading Here

There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.

River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Don't you think she looks tired? Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! Goodbye...my Sarah Jane!

Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Allons-y! Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice.
